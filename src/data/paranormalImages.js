    title: "EMF Meter",
    history: "The EMF meter, first used in paranormal investigations in the 1970s, revolutionized ghost hunting by detecting electromagnetic field fluctuations. These devices were originally designed for electricians but found a new purpose when investigators discovered that unexplained EMF spikes often coincided with reported paranormal activity.",
    features: [
      "Real-time EMF readings",
      "Color-coded intensity levels",
      "Historical data logging",
      "Anomaly detection",
      "Multi-axis field measurement",
      "Temperature correlation"
    ]

  temperature: {
    title: "Temperature Sensor",
    history: "Temperature sensors became essential tools in paranormal research after investigators noticed dramatic temperature drops in allegedly haunted locations. These 'cold spots,' often dropping 20-30 degrees below ambient temperature, have been documented in countless investigations since the early 1900s.",
    features: [
      "Precision temperature monitoring",
      "Cold spot detection",
      "Thermal mapping",
      "Rate of change alerts",
      "Environmental baseline tracking",
      "Multi-zone comparison"

    title: "EVP Recorder",
    history: "Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) recording began in the 1950s when Friedrich JÃ¼rgenson discovered unexplained voices in his bird song recordings. This discovery led to the development of specialized recording equipment designed to capture voices and sounds beyond normal human hearing range.",
    features: [
      "High-sensitivity recording",
      "Noise reduction filtering",
      "Frequency isolation",
      "Voice pattern recognition",

    title: "Spirit Box",
    history: "The Spirit Box, developed in the early 2000s, represents a modern approach to paranormal communication. By rapidly scanning radio frequencies, it creates white noise that theoretically allows spirits to manipulate the audio fragments into coherent responses. This controversial tool has become a staple in contemporary ghost hunting.",
    features: [
      "Rapid frequency scanning",
      "Voice pattern detection",
      "Frequency isolation",
      "Response recording",
      "Real-time analysis",
